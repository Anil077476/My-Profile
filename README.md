# My Profile
A Profile site to display skills, experience and works. Angular website build by me using [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/) design.

Prod Link :- https://www.tilakpuli.me

## Story 
I am react guy who has 2+ experience working on production scale react UI projejct. But I never got chance to work on Angular project and was curious to know what Angular provides. And also at same time I needed portfolio site. So I build this with Angular using @Brittany Chiang's profolio site as reference (As I wanted to build this quick and only concentrate on Angular). Thanks Brittany for Design and some CSS. In next version, I am planing use my own design.

## How to use.
If you want to use this project as your profolio, Feel free to use it. But please credit it to Brittany Chiang as she deserves it. 

1. Open data.ts in porfile folder and you can see most of my text data is present there. Replace it with your's.
2. Go to Assests and update profile image and Resume. Done.

## ToDo's for Next Version
1. Create a new UX design for porfolio and implement. 
2. Find a better way to add google analytics tracking (Currently updating github pages index.html manually)


## How to deploy
For deploying this repo, I am using `angular-cli-ghpages` module for building and deploying to github pages. 
Run `ng deploy --base-href=__domain__url__ --cname=__domain__url` 
__domain__url__ example => www.tilakpuli.me
